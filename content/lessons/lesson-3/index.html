title: Lesson 3 - Drawing a Snake Multiple Times
layout: default
---
<p>Now that we have a snake being drawn on the screen, We're going 
to want to be able to draw it many times, for instance every time 
it moves.</p>

<p>To do this, we'll define a function which draws the snake 
it's given. Add the following line to the beginning of 
game/snake.js:</p>

<pre>
  var drawSnake = function(snakeToDraw) {
    var drawableSnake = { color: "green", pixels: snakeToDraw };
    var drawableObjects = [drawableSnake];
    CHUNK.draw(drawableObjects);
  }
</pre>

<p>Functions are objects in Javascript that wrap a set of statements, 
and are meant to be reusable.</p>

<p>You'll notice this is similar to how we used the `var` keyword 
and `=` symbol to create the snake earlier. The only difference 
is instead of assigning a list of objects to a variable, we're 
assigning a chunk of code that we want to use later.</p>

<p>Now all we have to do is call drawSnake with a snake and it 
will be drawn on the screen! Write the following under the 
drawSnake function.</p>

<pre>
  var snake = [{ top: 0, left: 0}];
  drawSnake(snake);
</pre>

<h3>How the computer is interpreting this code:</h3>
<p>"Hey Sean, I'm going to teach you how to draw a snake. When 
someone tells you to `drawSnake` and hands you a `snakeToDraw`, 
you are going to create an object called `drawableSnake` with a 
color of blue and pixels of `snakeToDraw`. Create a list of 
`drawableObjects` and put the drawableSnakein it. Now get the 
value of draw from  CHUNK and hand it the drawableObjects. Thanks!"</p>

<p>"Hey Sean? Remember `drawSnake`? Well, draw this snake!"</p>

<h3>Expected Results</h3>
<p>Your snake.js:</p>
<pre>
  var drawSnake = function(snakeToDraw) {
    var drawableSnake = { color: "green", pixels: snakeToDraw };
    var drawableObjects = [drawableSnake];
    CHUNK.draw(drawableObjects);
  }
  var snake = [{ top: 0, left: 0}];
  drawSnake(snake);
</pre>

<p>The running game:</p>

<canvas id="chunk-game" height="600" width="800"></canvas>

<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/chunk.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  var drawSnake = function(snakeToDraw) {
    var drawableSnake = { color: "green", pixels: snakeToDraw };
    var drawableObjects = [drawableSnake];
    CHUNK.draw(drawableObjects);
  }
  var snake = [{ top: 0, left: 0}];
  drawSnake(snake);
</script>

<h3>Play Time!</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Open up the console and play around with making the
  snake move by calling `drawSnake` with snakes that have 
  different `top` and `left` values for their segment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Syntax Breakdown</h3>

<p>`function() { }` says "Hey, between the curly braces is some 
code we want to be able to execute." Functions can be stored inside 
variables just like words and numbers and objects and lists.</p>

<p>`(` and `)` in this case are a way to say that this function expects
a value to be given to it when it is called. These values are called
`arguments`, and can be used inside of the function body (the code between
the curly braces).</p>
