title: Lesson 4 - Moving a Single Segment Snake
layout: default
---

<p>Now that we have a function to draw the snake, we want to move the snake.
Lets write a function which takes a snake and changes its segments top and left
values.</p>

<p>To make our lives easier, let's make some assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The snake is only 1 segment long</li>
  <li>The snake always moves down</li>
</ul>

<p>By making these assumptions it keeps the code clear and makes it easy to
take small steps. Add the following code to your snake.js file: </p>

<pre>
var moveSnake = function(snake) {
  var oldSegment = snake[0];
  var newSegment = { top: oldSegment.top + 1, left: oldSegment.left };
  var newSnake = [newSegment];
  return newSnake;
}
</pre>

<p>Once we have this `moveSnake` function, we can call it and it will give us a
snake whose segments location has changed. We can then call `drawSnake` with
that snake and see it move across the screen!</p>

<p>Type the following lines into your javascript console a few times:</p>

<pre>
  snake = moveSnake(snake);
  drawSnake(snake);
</pre>

<h3>How the computer is interpreting this code:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Hey Sean, I'm teaching you how to move a snake.</p>
  <p>First, Get the value of the first segment and assign it to a variable
  caled oldSegment.</p>

  <p>Second, create a new hash whose top is one more than the oldSegments
  top and whose left is the same as the oldSegments left. </p>

  <p>Third, create a new snake which is an array containing just the new
  segment.</p>

  <p>Fourth, give the new snake to whoever asked to move the snake."</p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Expected Results</h3>

<p>Your snake.js:</p>
<pre>
var drawSnake = function(snakeToDraw) {
  var drawableSnake = { color: "blue", pixels: snakeToDraw };
  var drawableObjects = [drawableSnake];
  CHUNK.draw(drawableObjects);
}

var moveSnake = function(snake) {
  var oldSegment = snake[0];
  var newSegment = { top: oldSegment.top + 1, left: oldSegment.left };
  var newSnake = [newSegment];
  return newSnake;
}

var snake = [{ top: 0, left: 0}];
drawSnake(snake);
</pre>

<p>The running game:</p>
<canvas id="chunk-game" height="600" width="800"></canvas>

<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/chunk.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
var drawSnake = function(snakeToDraw) {
  var drawableSnake = { color: "blue", pixels: snakeToDraw };
  var drawableObjects = [drawableSnake];
  CHUNK.draw(drawableObjects);
}

var moveSnake = function(snake) {
  var oldSegment = snake[0];
  var newSegment = { top: oldSegment.top + 1, left: oldSegment.left };
  var newSnake = [newSegment];
  return newSnake;
}

var snake = [{ top: 0, left: 0}];
drawSnake(snake);
</script>

<h3>Play Time!</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Why does adding 1 to a segments top value move it down?</li>
  <li>Can you make the snake move right intead of down?</li>
  <li>What happens to the newSnake variable? Can you use it outside of the
  moveSnake function body (within the curly braces)?</li>
  <li>Why are we re-assigning snake the results of moveSnake?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Syntax Breakdown</h3>

<p> `return value` - Tells the function to immediately respond with whatever
value it is given. In this case, the newSnake.  </p>

<p>`array[location] -"Get the value at this location in the array." Arrays in
most programming languages are "zero-indexed" i.e. the first element is at 0,
the second is at 1, and so on.  </p>

<p>`+` adds the values on the left and right together. Surprise, eh?</p>
